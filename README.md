# Next.js Blog Website

This is a simple blog web application built using Next.js. It was created as a learning project to explore and implement key web development concepts, including:

    Basic CRUD operations

    API validation using Zod

    Understanding and working with the Next.js framework

# Learning Goals

1.  Basic CRUD Operations

    Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for blog posts.

    Users can:

        Create new blog posts

        View a list of existing posts

        Edit and update posts

        Delete posts

2.  API Validation with Zod

    All API routes use Zod for input validation and type safety.

    Ensures only valid data is processed and helps catch errors early.

3.  Working with Next.js

    Explored the Next.js App Router and File-Based Routing

    Utilized an existing image API from another project for image uplaoding

    Utilized Server and Client Components where appropriate

    Employed Server Actions and Custom React Hooks for interactivity

4.  Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

    Explored using dockerhub and a custom webhook to achieve CI/CD
